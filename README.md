# HiddenFounders_MobileCodingChallenge
HiddenFounders iOS/Android Coding Challenge

**Version 1.0**

This [challenge](https://github.com/hiddenfounders/mobile-coding-challenge) is proposed by HiddenFounders.

## Overview
The idea is to create a mobile application (IOS / Android) that lists the top trending repositories that were created in the last 30 days using the Github API.

It allows the user ... :
* ... to list the most starred Github repos that were created in the last 30 days.
* ... to see the results as a list. One repository per row.
* ... to see for each repo/row the following details :
    * Repository name
    * Repository description
    * Numbers of stars for the repo.
    * Username and avatar of the owner.
* ... to be able to keep scrolling and new results should appear.

## Development tools
I used Android studio as an IDE with Java as a programming language and RecyclerView instead of ListView.

For Transmitting Network Data, i used [Volley](https://github.com/google/volley).

For image loading, i used [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide).

## Final result
